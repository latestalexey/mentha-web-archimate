    <info>The influence relationship models that an element affects the implementation or achievement of some motivation element.</info>
    <info>The influence relationship is used to describe that some architectural element influences achievement or implementation of a motivation element, such as a goal or a principle. In general, a motivation element is realized to a certain degree.</info>
    <text>Additional to this ‘vertical’ use of contribution, from core elements upwards to requirements and goals, the relationship can also be used to model ‘horizontal’ contributions between motivation elements. The influence relationship in that case describes that some motivation element may influence (the achievement or implementation of) another motivation element. In general, a motivation element is achieved to a certain degree. An influence by some other element may affect this degree, depending on the degree in which this other element is satisfied itself.</text>
    <text>The realization relationship should be used to represent relationships that are critical to the existence or realization of the target, while the influence relationship should be used to represent relationships that are not critical to the target object’s existence or realization.</text>
    <text>Moreover, an influence relationship can be used to model either: (1) The fact that an element positively contributes to the achievement or implementation of some motivation element, or (2) The fact that an element negatively influences – i.e., prevents or counteracts – such achievement.</text>
    <text>Attributes can be used to indicate the sign and/or strength of the influence. The choice of possible attribute values is left to the modeler; e.g., {++, +, 0, -, --} or [0..10]. By default, the influence relationship models a contribution with unspecified sign and strength.</text>

    <info>A stakeholder is the role of an individual, team, or organization (or classes thereof) that represents their interests in the outcome of the architecture.</info>
    <text>This definition is based on the definition in the TOGAF framework. A stakeholder has one or more interests in, or concerns about, the organization and its Enterprise Architecture. In order to direct efforts to these interests and concerns, stakeholders change, set, and emphasize goals. Stakeholders may also influence each other. Examples of stakeholders are the CEO, the board of directors, shareholders, customers, business and application architects, but also legislative authorities. The name of a stakeholder should preferably be a noun.</text>

    <info>A driver represents an external or internal condition that motivates an organization to define its goals and implement the changes necessary to achieve them.</info>
    <text>Drivers may be internal, in which case they are usually associated with a stakeholder, and are often called “concerns”. Stakeholder concerns are defined in the TOGAF framework as ”the key interests that are crucially important to the stakeholders in a system, and determine the acceptability of the system. Concerns may pertain to any aspect of the function, development, or operation of the system, including considerations such as performance, reliability, security, distribution, and evolvability.” Examples of internal drivers are Customer satisfaction and Profitability. Drivers of change may also be external; e.g., economic changes or changing legislation. The name of a driver should preferably be a noun.</text>

    <info>An assessment represents the result of an analysis of the state of affairs of the enterprise with respect to some driver.</info>
    <text>An assessment may reveal strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, or threats for some area of interest. These need to be addressed by adjusting existing goals or setting new ones, which may trigger changes to the Enterprise Architecture.</text>
    <text>Strengths and weaknesses are internal to the organization. Opportunities and threats are external to the organization. Weaknesses and threats can be considered as problems that need to be addressed by goals that “negate” the weaknesses and threats. Strengths and opportunities may be translated directly into goals. For example, the weakness “Customers complain about the helpdesk” can be addressed by defining the goal “Improve helpdesk”. Or, the opportunity “Customers favor insurances that can be managed online” can be addressed by the goal “Introduce online portfolio management”. The name of an assessment should preferably be a noun or a (very) short sentence.</text>

    <summ>A high-level statement of intent, direction, or desired end state for an organization and its stakeholders.</summ>
    <info>A goal represents a high-level statement of intent, direction, or desired end state for an organization and its stakeholders.</info>
    <text>In principle, a goal can represent anything a stakeholder may desire, such as a state of affairs, or a produced value. Examples of goals are: to increase profit, to reduce waiting times at the helpdesk, or to introduce online portfolio management. Goals are typically used to measure success of an organization.</text>
    <text>Goals are generally expressed using qualitative words; e.g., “increase”, “improve”, or “easier”. Goals can also be decomposed; e.g., Increase profit can be decomposed into the goals Reduce cost and Increase sales. However, it is also very common to associate concrete outcomes with goals, which can be used to describe both the quantitative and time-related results that are essential to describe the desired state, and when it should be achieved.</text>
  </element>

  <element name="Outcome" layer="Motivation" key="moc" parent="GenericElement">

    <summ>An end result that has been achieved.</summ>
    <info>An outcome represents an end result that has been achieved.</info>
    <text>Outcomes are high-level, business-oriented results produced by capabilities of an organization, and by inference by the core elements of its architecture that realize these capabilities. Outcomes are tangible, possibly quantitative, and time-related, and can be associated with assessments. An outcome may have a different value for different stakeholders.</text>
    <text>The notion of outcome is important in business outcome-driven approaches to Enterprise Architecture and in capability-based planning. Outcomes are closely related to requirements, goals, and other intentions. Outcomes are the end results, and goals or requirements are often formulated in terms of outcomes that should be realized. Capabilities are designed to achieve such outcomes.</text>
    <text>Outcome names should unambiguously identify end results that have been achieved in order to avoid confusion with actions or goals. At a minimum, outcome names should consist of a noun identifying the end result followed by a past-tense verb or adjective indicating that the result has been achieved. Examples include “First-place ranking achieved” and “Key supplier partnerships in place”. Outcome names can also be more specific; e.g., “2015 quarterly profits rose 10% year over year beginning in Q3”.</text>

    <summ>A qualitative statement of intent that should be met by the architecture.</summ>
    <info>A principle represents a qualitative statement of intent that should be met by the architecture.</info>
    <text>Principles are strongly related to goals and requirements. Similar to requirements, principles define intended properties of systems. However, in contrast to requirements, principles are broader in scope and more abstract than requirements. A principle defines a general property that applies to any system in a certain context. A requirement defines a property that applies to a specific system as described by an architecture.</text>
    <text>A principle needs to be made specific for a given system by means of one or more requirements, in order to enforce that the system conforms to the principle. For example, the principle “Information management processes comply with all relevant laws, policies, and regulations” is realized by the requirements that are imposed by the actual laws, policies, and regulations that apply to the specific system under design.</text>
    <text>A principle is motivated by some goal or driver. For example, the aforementioned principle may be motivated by the goal to maintain a good reputation and/or the goal to avoid penalties. The principle provides a means to realize its motivating goal, which is generally formulated as a guideline. This guideline constrains the design of all systems in a given context by stating the general properties that are required from any system in this context to realize the goal. Principles are intended to be more stable than requirements in the sense that they do not change as quickly as requirements may do. Organizational values, best practices, and design knowledge may be reflected and made applicable in terms of principles.</text>

    <summ>A statement of need that must be met by the architecture.</summ>
    <info>A requirement represents a statement of need that must be met by the architecture.</info>
    <text>In the end, a business goal must be realized by a plan or concrete change goal, which may or may not require a new system or changes to an existing system.</text>
    <text>The term “system” is used in its general meaning; i.e., as a group of (functionally) related elements, where each element may be considered as a system again. Therefore, a system may refer to any active structural element, behavior element, or passive structural element of some organization, such as a business actor, application component, business process, application service, business object, or data object.</text>
    <text>Requirements model the properties of these elements that are needed to achieve the “ends” that are modeled by the goals. In this respect, requirements represent the “means” to realize goals.</text>
    <text>During the design process, goals may be decomposed until the resulting sub-goals are sufficiently detailed to enable their realization by properties that can be exhibited by systems. At this point, goals can be realized by requirements that demand these properties from the systems.</text>
    <text>For example, one may identify two alternative requirements to realize the goal to improve portfolio management: (1) By assigning a personal assistant to each customer, or (2) By introducing online portfolio management. The former requirement can be realized by a human actor and the latter by a software application. These requirements can be decomposed further to define the requirements on the human actor and the software application in more detail.</text>

    <info>A constraint represents a factor that prevents or obstructs the realization of goals.</info>
    <text>In contrast to a requirement, a constraint does not prescribe some intended functionality of the system to be realized, but imposes a restriction on the way it operates or may be realized. This may be a restriction on the implementation of the system (e.g., specific technology that is to be used), a restriction on the implementation process (e.g., time or budget constraints), or a restriction on the functioning of the system (e.g., legal constraints).</text>

    <info>Meaning represents the knowledge or expertise present in, or the interpretation given to, a core element in a particular context.</info>
    <text>A meaning represents the interpretation of an element of the architecture. In particular, this is used to describe the meaning of passive structure elements (for example, a document, message). It is a description that expresses the intent of that element; i.e., how it informs the external user.</text>
    <text>It is possible that different users view the informative functionality of an element differently. For example, what may be a “registration confirmation” for a client could be a “client mutation” for a CRM department (assuming for the sake of argument that it is modeled as an external user). Also, various different representations may carry essentially the same meaning. For example, various different documents (a web document, a filled-in paper form, a “client contact” report from the call center) may essentially carry the same meaning.</text>
    <text>A meaning can be associated with any core element. To denote that a meaning is specific to a particular stakeholder, this stakeholder can also be associated to the meaning. The name of a meaning should preferably be a noun or noun phrase.</text>

    <info>Value represents the relative worth, utility, or importance of a core element or an outcome.</info>
    <text>Value may apply to what a party gets by selling or making available some product or service, or it may apply to what a party gets by buying or obtaining access to it. Value is often expressed in terms of money, but it has long since been recognized that non-monetary value is also essential to business; for example, practical/functional value (including the right to use a service), and the value of information or knowledge. Though value can hold internally for some system or organizational unit, it is most typically applied to external appreciation of goods, services, information, knowledge, or money, normally as part of some sort of customer-provider relationship.</text>
    <text>A value can be associated with all core elements of an architecture as well as with outcomes. To model the stakeholder for whom this value applies, this stakeholder can also be associated with that value. Although the name of a value can be expressed in many different ways (including amounts, objects), where the “functional” value of an architecture element is concerned it is recommended to try and express it as an action or state that can be performed or reached as a result of the corresponding element being available.</text>

Resources are analyzed in terms of strengths and weaknesses, and they are considered when implementing strategies. Due to resources being limited, they can often be a deciding factor for choosing which strategy, goal, and project to implement and in which order. Resources can be classified into tangible assets – financial assets (e.g., cash, securities, borrowing capacity), physical assets (e.g., plant, equipment, land, mineral reserves), intangible assets (technology; e.g., patents, copyrights, trade secrets; reputation; e.g., brand, relationships; culture), and human assets (skills/know-how, capacity for communication and collaboration, motivation).</text>

    <info>A capability represents an ability that an active structure element, such as an organization, person, or system, possesses.</info>
    <text>In the field of business, strategic thinking and planning delivers strategies and high-level goals that are often not directly implementable in the architecture of an organization. These long-term or generic plans need to be specified and made actionable in a way that both business leaders and Enterprise Architects can relate to and at a relatively high abstraction level.</text>
    <text>Capabilities help to reduce this gap by focusing on business outcomes. On the one hand, they provide a high-level view of the current and desired abilities of an organization, in relation to its strategy and its environment. On the other hand, they are realized by various elements (people, processes, systems, and so on) that can be described, designed, and implemented using Enterprise Architecture approaches. Capabilities may also have serving relationships; for example, to denote that one capability contributes to another.</text>
    <text>Capabilities are expressed in general and high-level terms and are typically realized by a combination of organization, people, processes, information, and technology. For example, marketing, customer contact, or outbound telemarketing.</text>
    <text>Capabilities are typically aimed at achieving some goal or delivering value by realizing an outcome. Capabilities are themselves realized by core elements. To denote that a set of core elements together realizes a capability, grouping can be used.</text>
    <text>Capabilities are often used for capability-based planning, to describe their evolution over time. To model such so-called capability increments, the specialization relationship can be used to denote that a certain capability increment is a specific version of that capability. Aggregating those increments and the core elements that realize them in plateaus can be used to model the evolution of the capabilities.</text>

    <info>A business actor is a business entity that is capable of performing behavior.</info>
    <text>A business actor is a business entity as opposed to a technical entity; i.e., it belongs to the Business Layer. Actors may, however, include entities outside the actual organization; e.g., customers and partners. A business actor can represent such business entities at different levels of detail, and may correspond to both an actor and an organizational unit in the TOGAF framework. Examples of business actors are humans, departments, and business units.</text>
    <text>A business actor may be assigned to one or more business roles. It can then perform the behavior to which these business roles are assigned. A business actor can be aggregated in a location. The name of a business actor should preferably be a noun. Business actors may be specific individuals or organizations; e.g., “John Smith” or “ABC Corporation”, or they may be generic; e.g., “Customer” or “Supplier”.</text>

    <info>A business role is the responsibility for performing specific behavior, to which an actor can be assigned, or the part an actor plays in a particular action or event.</info>
    <text>Business roles with certain responsibilities or skills are assigned to business processes or business functions. A business actor that is assigned to a business role is responsible that the corresponding behavior is carried out, either by performing it or by delegating and managing its performance. In addition to the relation of a business role with behavior, a business role is also useful in a (structural) organizational sense; for instance, in the division of labor within an organization.</text>
    <text>A business role may be assigned to one or more business processes or business functions, while a business actor may be assigned to one or more business roles. A business interface or an application interface may serve a business role, while a business interface may be part of a business role (through a composition relationship, which is not shown explicitly in the interface notation). The name of a business role should preferably be a noun.</text>
    <text>ArchiMate modelers may represent generic organizational entities that perform behavior as either business actors or business roles. For example, the business actor Supplier depicts an organizational entity, while the business role Supplier depicts a responsibility. Specific or generic business actors can be assigned to carry responsibilities depicted as business roles. For example, the specific business actor ABC Corporation or the generic business actor Business Partner can be assigned to the Supplier business role.</text>

    <info>A business collaboration is an aggregate of two or more business internal active structure elements that work together to perform collective behavior.</info>
    <text>A business process or function may be interpreted as the internal behavior of a single business role. In some cases, behavior is the collective effort of more than one business role; in fact, a collaboration of two or more business roles results in collective behavior which may be more than simply the sum of the behavior of the separate roles.</text>
    <text>Business collaborations represent this collective effort. Business interactions are used to describe the internal behavior that takes place within business collaboration. A collaboration is a (possibly temporary) collection of business roles or actors within an organization, which perform collaborative behavior (interactions). Unlike a department, which may also group roles, a business collaboration need not have an official (permanent) status within the organization; it is specifically aimed at a specific interaction or set of interactions between roles. It is especially useful in modeling B2B interactions between different organizations such as provider networks, and also for describing social networks.</text>
    <text>A business collaboration may aggregate a number of business roles or actors, and may be assigned to one or more business interactions or other business internal behavior elements. A business interface or an application interface may serve a business collaboration, while a business collaboration may have business interfaces (through composition, and also through aggregation via derived relationships). The name of a business collaboration should preferably be a noun. It is also rather common to leave a business collaboration unnamed.</text>

    <info>A business process represents a sequence of business behaviors that achieves a specific outcome such as a defined set of products or business services.</info>
    <text>A business process describes the internal behavior performed by a business role that is required to produce a set of products and services. For a consumer, the products and services are relevant and the required behavior is merely a black box, hence the designation “internal”.</text>
    <text>A complex business process may be an aggregation of other, finer-grained processes. To each of these, finer-grained roles may be assigned.</text>
    <text>There is a potential many-to-many relationship between business processes and business functions. Informally speaking, processes describe some kind of “flow” of activities, whereas functions group activities according to required skills, knowledge, resources, etc.</text>
    <text>A business process may be triggered by, or trigger, any other business behavior element (e.g., business event, business process, business function, or business interaction). A business process may access business objects. A business process may realize one or more business services and may use (internal) business services or application services. A business role may be assigned to a business process to perform this process manually or automated, respectively. The name of a business process should clearly indicate a predefined sequence of actions, and may include the word “process”. Examples are “adjudicate claim”, “employee on-boarding”, “approval process”, or “financial reporting”.</text>
    <text>In an ArchiMate model, the existence of business processes is depicted. High-level business, end-to-end processes, macro flows, and workflows can all be expressed with the same business process element in the ArchiMate language. It does not, however, list the flow of activities in detail. This is typically done during business process modeling, where a business process can be expanded using a business process design language; e.g., BPMN.</text>

    <info>A business function is a collection of business behavior based on a chosen set of criteria (typically required business resources and/or competences), closely aligned to an organization, but not necessarily explicitly governed by the organization.</info>
    <text>Just like a business process, a business function also describes internal behavior performed by a business role. However, while a business process groups behavior based on a sequence or flow of activities that is needed to realize a product or service, a business function typically groups behavior based on required business resources, skills, competences, knowledge, etc.</text>
    <text>There is a potential many-to-many relation between business processes and business functions. Complex processes in general involve activities that offer various functions. In this sense a business process forms a string of business functions. In general, a business function delivers added value from a business point of view. Organizational units or applications may coincide with business functions due to their specific grouping of business activities.</text>
    <text>A business function may be triggered by, or trigger, any other business behavior element (business event, business process, business function, or business interaction). A business function may access business objects. A business function may realize one or more business services and may be served by business, application, or technology services. A business role may be assigned to a business function. The name of a business function should clearly indicate a well-defined behavior. Examples are customer management, claims administration, member services, recycling, or payment processing.</text>

    <info>A business event is a business behavior element that denotes an organizational state change. It may originate from and be resolved inside or outside the organization.</info>
    <text>Business processes and other business behavior may be triggered or interrupted by a business event. Also, business processes may raise events that trigger other business processes, functions, or interactions. Unlike business processes, functions, and interactions, a business event is instantaneous: it does not have duration. Events may originate from the environment of the organization (e.g., from a customer), but also internal events may occur generated by, for example, other processes within the organization.</text>
    <text>A business event may have a time attribute that denotes the moment or moments at which the event happens. For example, this can be used to model time schedules; e.g., to model an event that triggers a recurring business process to execute every first Monday of the month.</text>
    <text>A business event may trigger or be triggered (raised) by a business process, business function, or business interaction.

    <info>A business object represents a concept used within a particular business domain.</info>
    <text>The ArchiMate language in general focuses on the modeling of types, not instances, since this is the most relevant at the Enterprise Architecture level of description. Hence a business object typically models an object type (cf. a UML class) of which multiple instances may exist in operations. Only occasionally, business objects represent actual instances of information produced and consumed by behavior elements such as business processes. This is in particular the case for singleton types; i.e., types that have only one instance.</text>
    <text>A wide variety of types of business objects can be defined. Business objects are passive in the sense that they do not trigger or perform processes. A business object could be used to represent information assets that are relevant from a business point of view and can be realized by data objects.</text>
    <text>Business objects may be accessed (e.g., in the case of information objects, they may be created, read, written) by a business process, function, business interaction, business event, or business service. A business object may have association, specialization, aggregation, or composition relationships with other business objects. A business object may be realized by a representation or by a data object (or both). The name of a business object should preferably be a noun.</text>

    <info>A product represents a coherent collection of services and/or passive structure elements, accompanied by a contract/set of agreements, which is offered as a whole to (internal or external) customers.</info>
    <text>This definition covers both intangible, services-based, or information products that are common in information-intensive organizations, and tangible, physical products. A financial or information product consists of a collection of services, and a contract that specifies the characteristics, rights, and requirements associated with the product. “Buying” a product gives the customer the right to use the associated services.</text>
    <text>Generally, the product element is used to specify a product type. The number of product types in an organization is typically relatively stable compared to, for example, the processes that realize or support the products. “Buying” is usually one of the services associated with a product, which results in a new instance of that product (belonging to a specific customer). Similarly, there may be services to modify or destroy a product.</text>
    <text>A product may aggregate or compose business services, application services, and technology services, business objects, data objects, and technology objects, as well as a contract. Hence a product may aggregate or compose elements from other layers than the Business Layer.</text>
    <text>A value may be associated with a product. The name of a product is usually the name which is used in the communication with customers, or possibly a more generic noun (e.g., “travel insurance”).</text>
